# Python-Lockdown
Hi, My name is Daniel Watson and I have been trying python coding during my self-isolation period. All my code can be easily modified to what you want. Here is what I have got so far:

1. variables
This is a simple program that allows you to create a variable with your name and age and then print it in a sentence. The code can be easily modified to display another name, age or variable.

2. input
This program allows the user to input 2 numbers when running the code. It will then add those 2 numbers together before displaying the total. The code can be easily modifieed to divide, subtract, multiply etc.

3. if statements
This program allows the user to input a temperature and the the program will give advice depending on the temperature.

4. exercise
This program uses all of the above methods to crate a simple program that allows the user to input their weight and say if it's in Lbs or Kgs. It will then convert the weight to the other unit.

5. while loops
This program prints out a string repeatedly using one for loop.

6. lists
This prints a list of names using only one print line. The list is changed and only some items are printed.

7. lists methods
This shows what you can do with lists, insert or append or remove numbers, check for numbers, check how many numbers etc.

8. for loops
This prints of a list of numbers and is compared against a while loop.

9. the range function
This is an even more efficient way to print a list of numbers.

10. tuples
This explains that tuples are basically lists that cannot be changed later on.
