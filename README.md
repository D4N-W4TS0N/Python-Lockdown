# Python-Lockdown
Hi, My name is Daniel Watson and I have been trying python coding during my self-isolation period. All my code can be easily modified to what you want. Here is what I have got so far:

1. variables
This is a simple program that allows you to create a variable with your name and age and then print it in a sentence. The code can be easily modified to display another name, age or variable.

2. input
This program allows the user to input 2 numbers when running the code. It will then add those 2 numbers together before displaying the total. The code can be easily modifieed to divide, subtract, multiply etc.

3. if statements
This program allows the user to input a temperature and the the program will give advice depending on the temperature.

4. exercise
This program uses all of the above methods to crate a simple program that allows the user to input their weight and say if it's in Lbs or Kgs. It will then convert the weight to the other unit
